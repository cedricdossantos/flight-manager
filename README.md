## Context

Dear readers/developers,

This project is a sample showing my skills on Asp.net core Web API. 
I tried as much as I could to develop with a TDD philosophy and with the objectif of making my code testable and tested.
I decided to persist all the data inmemory on my program by using [Enty Framework Core Inmemory](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) (which means, everything is lost when the project is restarded, yep I know).
I could have used mongodb or elasticsearch but I thought it easier for me to show my way of programming without some extra technologies (even if I am using them professionaly).


Regards
