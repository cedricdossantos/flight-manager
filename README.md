# flight-manager

## Context

Dear recruiter,

This project is a sample showing my skills on Asp.net core Web API. 
I tried as much as I could to develop with a test-first philosophy (TDD) and with the objectif of making my code testable and tested.
I decided to persist all the data inmemory on my program (which means, everything is lost when the project is restarded, yep I know).
I could have used mongodb or elasticsearch but I thought it easier for me to show my way of programming without some extra technologies (even if I am using them professionaly).
Since I am not an expert at calculating flying distance, I decided to use [GeoCoordinate.NetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GeoCoordinate.NetCore) to manipulate the coordinates and do the distance calculation.
This is not some elaborated code, I could think of a lot of improvements if it was not just a sample project. Maybe some part of this project don't 
 follow the guidelines you are used to follow, I hope not. In any case, I would be please to discuss it with you.

Regards
